## Green

1. When starting the new project in Unity, make sure to use the 2D template!
2. Now make a 2D platformer of your choice, it could be a Super Mario clone, a Commander Keen
clone or whatever you want.
3. The player must move with arrows or WSAD
4. Make the camera follow the player
5. The player character must be animated, meaning that as a minimum the player character must
change between at least 2 sprites when running.
6. The player can jump onto platforms
7. There must be at least one powerup, like super speed, extra health, invulnerability
8. There must be enemies that kill you instantly or make you loose health
9. Make at least 1 element “juiced”, for example a nice visual effect when you pick up the power up
or when you win.

## Yellow

1. Make enemies patrol back and forth on the platforms
2. Make the player able to shoot the enemies and/or jump on their heads to kill them
3. Make the player able to pick up guns/ammo in order to shoot.

5. Upgrade your camera to Cinemachine, see “Useful Ressources” above.

## Red

1. Make multiple levels
2. Make doors and keys, for example play must find the red key to open the red door.

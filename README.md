# Games-Assignment-7

## Green

1. Deploy the game to Google play or Apple app store, it could be the one you made in Assignment 6.
2. The game must be playable – I won’t accept “Hello World” apps or broken games.
3. The game must work on a normal device, and not only on your strange android tablet from Korea.
4. The game must have at least 2 separate scenes, for example a main menu scene and a game scene.
When I press play on main menu, I go to game, when I die/fail, I go back to menu. Make sure to add
your scenes to the build in “Build settings”.
5. Requirements for the game are so simple here, since the deployment pipeline / tool chain setup is
more complex

## Yellow

1. Add some library to your game. It could be analytics, In app purchase, ads, high score, etc.

## Red

1. Export your game to webgl too, and deploy to a web server.
